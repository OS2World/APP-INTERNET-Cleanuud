Very quick and dirty program to cleanup quoted uuencoded files.
Don't you hate it when someone quotes the entire post just to add a line or
two of comments?
Should also work for mime/base 64.  C Source is included so if
any problems arise, YOU can fix them.  The exe is for os/2 ver 2.0+, but
the source should compile to other platforms pretty easily.
This program and the source is hereby released to the public domain.
Since I get no money for this, don't expect any help or updated versions.
Just run the program with no parameters for what little help there is.
Also, do NOT run the program with the input.uud and output.uud the same file
or it will be lost!
